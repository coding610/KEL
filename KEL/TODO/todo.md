* Make it easier to add a compoennt after initzialation
* Make folders for objects
* Layers
* Make so that 
* Make hitboxes class so that it des not utgå ifrån transformComp


WORKING:
* Make collidePoly interfere with rects
* Make collideRect overagain with collidePoly as a base


DONE IN THIS UPDATE:
* Make so that every object has hitboxes on or off
* Make a Documentation markdown file
* Make a function to get all the objects
* Sockets is unessesary so I deleted it
* Make so collideComp gets all the objects
* Make so polyTransform gets infinite points
* Make so transformPoly points is relative to the other one. So if one is moved then the other one is too (done with moveX() and moveY())
* Make so collidePoly gets all the points (not just the four shown)
* Make SAT collision
* Make some sort of preset creating tool for a main script and component script
* Make transform comp __init__ values
* deltaTime
